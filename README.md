# üçä Orange Eater

## Description

**Orange Eater** is a fun web application that simulates eating oranges, keeping track of how many oranges you have left in your pocket.
Each time an orange is eaten, the color and the count dynamically change, providing a colorful and interactive experience.

This project is a great exercise in DOM manipulation and setTimeout to simulate time delays in JavaScript.

## Features

- Displays the initial count of oranges in your pocket.
- Simulates eating one orange at a time.
- The number of oranges decreases with each "bite."
- Colorful feedback on the action of eating oranges (via background colors).
- All interactions are shown live on the page.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Bootstrap 5 (for styling)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Watch as the oranges are eaten one by one, with real-time updates!

## How It Works

- A total of 20 oranges are initialized in the script.
- Every 500ms, one orange is eaten, and the number left is updated.
- Each eaten orange is visually represented by a colored span, with the color determined dynamically.

## Setup

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:
